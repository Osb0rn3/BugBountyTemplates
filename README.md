# Bug Bounty Templates
A collection of templates for bug bounty reporting, with guides on how to write and fill out. Not the core standard on how to report but certainly a flow I follow personally which has been successful for me. Your milage may vary.

Feel free to clone down, modify, suggest changes, tweet me ideas [@ZephrFish](https://twitter.com/ZephrFish).

## Templates Included
- Blank Template
- Headers only Template

## Writing Markdown 
Sometimes manipulating markdown for some can be an alien task, luckily there are several tools out there for writing it and helping out, below is a list of some for online,windows, OSX & Linux.

VS Code now supports markdown by default via plugins, and so do many other text editors. VSCode is cross platform and a good option for writing.
